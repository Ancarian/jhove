<h1>Building JHOVE</h1>
<p>
Here are the instructions for building JHOVE. Lots of care is required.
</p>
<ul>
<li > Update Jhove.java and JhoveView.java so that DATE and RELEASE reflect the current version.
</li>
<li > Update overview.html to reflect the current version in the JavaDoc.
</li>
<li > Run ant to build the latest jar files, and check all the jars in the bin directory into <acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym>.
</li>
<li > Update RELEASENOTES and README to document the newest version.
</li>
<li > Pick a directory to which you will check out a new copy of JHOVE for building.
</li>
<li > <code>cvs -z3 -d:ext:[username]@jhove.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jhove checkout jhove</code>
</li>
<li > [that&#039;s your SourceForge username, of course. If you don&#039;t intend to check anything in, you can check it out anonymously with <code>-d:pserver:anonymous@jhove.cvs.sourceforge.net</code>]]
</li>
<li > <code>cd jhove</code>
</li>
<li > <code>rm -r examples</code>
</li>
<li > <code>ant</code>
</li>
<li > [edit and test changes]
</li>
<li > <code>ant javadoc</code> (if the Javadoc needs updating)
</li>
<li > <code>cvs commit</code>  (Needed only if ant javadoc has been done)
</li>
<li > <code>./packagejhove.sh 1_n </code>
</li>
<li > [1_n is the version number, e.g., 1_8 for JHOVE 1.8]
</li>
<li > [Enter "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good" to confirm]
</li>
<li > [This replaces a lot of tedious steps in the old procedure]
</li>
<li > [save the checksum results for later posting]]
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The next step is to release to SourceForge. The instructions below are current as of May 2013. SourceForge likes to seriously rearrange its user interface from time to time.
</p>
<ul>
<li > Log on to SourceForge
</li>
<li > Go to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jhove/" class="urlextern" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jhove/"  rel="nofollow">JHOVE project</a> and click “Files”
</li>
<li > Click on “jhove” folder
</li>
<li > Click the “Add Folder” button
</li>
<li > Enter folder name, e.g., JHOVE 1.n (Creating folders from sftp doesn’t seem to work)
</li>
<li>Upload the following files to the newly created folder, using the Web interface:
<ul>
<li>  jhove-1_n.tar.gz</li>
<li>  jhove-1_n.zip</li>
<li>  jhove-1_n.tar.gz.md5</li>
<li>  jhove-1_n.zip.md5</li>
<li>  jhove/RELEASENOTES</li>
<li>  jhove/README.txt</li>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
When it's done, send out appropriate notifications.

To build the OS X application, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Run the application Jar Bundler. Apple keeps changing where you find it.
If you've installed Apple's developer tools, it may be in
<code>/usr/share/java/Tools/</code>.
</li>
<li>Click the "Choose" button and select <code>bin/JhoveView.jar</code>, then
enter <code>JhoveView</code> for the main class. Check all of "Use Macintosh
menu bar," "Anti-alias text," and "Anti-alias graphics." Set the JVM version
to "1.5+."
</li>
<li>Click "Choose icon..." and select <code>mac/jhove.icns</code>.
</li>
<li>Go to the "Properties" tab. Set the version to an appropriate
value, e.g., "1.10". Set Get-Info String to "JHOVE [version]", e.g.,
"JHOVE 1.10".
</li>
<li>
Click "Create Application..." and name the file to JHOVE_[version], replacing
the period with an underscore, e.g., "JHOVE_1_10". The extension ".app"
will be added automatically.
</li>
<li>
Zip the application. This is essential, since the application is really a folder
in disguise with a lot of files under it.
</li>
<li>
Upload the application to the "Files" page on SourceForge.
</ul>
