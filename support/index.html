<h1>Support JHOVE</h1>
JHOVE is one of the most widely-used digital preservation tools in the community, and it is also used as a component in several commercial digital preservation systems. It is open source meaning it is free to download, use and modify. However, it is not free of costs to host, maintain, support or develop the software. Currently, only OPF members support JHOVE as part of their membership fees.
<h2>So, how can you help?</h2>
    <h3>Become a JHOVE Software Supporter</h3>
The Open Preservation Foundation has set up a new way for users to support JHOVE development. By becoming a JHOVE Software Supporter, organisations are directly helping to fund the hosting, maintenance, and development of the software ensuring it is robust and reliable.
<p>
    Software Supporters can also choose to guide the roadmap and:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Sit on the JHOVE Product Board</li>
    <li> Vote for bug fixes and enhancements to be included in each release cycle</li>
    <li> Receive technical support</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Contribute to JHOVE</h3>

   We also welcome community contributions. We are looking for users and developers to join our active JHOVE community and help:

    <li> Test the software</li>
    <li> Improve documentation</li>
    <li> Contribute test files</li>
</ul>
<p>
    On 11 October 2016 we held our first JHOVE Hack Day where volunteers from around the world worked collaboratively to enhance our understanding of JHOVE errors and improve documentation. The <a href="http://openpreservation.org/blog/2016/10/19/jhove-online-hack-day-report/">report</a> from this day is published on the Foundation’s website. If you would like to contribute or get involved in the next hack day, please <a href="http://openpreservation.org/about/contact/">contact us</a>.
