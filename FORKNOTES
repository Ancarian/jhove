Notes on fork by Gary McGath
March 2, 2016

This fork contains a new module for PNG. At the moment it's a work
in progress but handles most files correctly. It doesn't cover all
chunks yet.

There was an unfinished PNG module in the project from a decade ago.
It's not bad code, but I discovered it only after making a start
and elected to continue with my own version. The old module 
validates files but extracts very little metadata. The whole
module is in one file; I prefer a more factored approach.

Keeping in mind that this hasn't been heavily tested yet, feel free
to play with it and submit bug reports. I'll submit a pull request
when I think it's approaching stability.
